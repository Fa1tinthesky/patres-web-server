Yet still, I need basics and concrete. Rust this time (not php ? NO, no php for now)

Undiscovered prequisites: 
- how to send and handle http requests and responses with Rust - DONE
- Edit html basing on response (???)

Basic RESTFul API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Get response for root html and 404 made.
- Some POST resonse

Chapters I'm curios about:
- Chapter 1. Introduction to general HTTP
- Chapter 5. How web content and server are built in real world
- Appendices.

- Add the project to github
