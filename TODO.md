Yet still, I need basics and concrete. Rust this time (not php ? NO, no php for now)

Undiscovered prequisites: 
- how to send and handle http requests and responses with Rust - DONE

Basic RESTFul API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Get response for root html and 404 - DONE 
- Some PUT method
- Some POST resonse
- Some DELETE method

Chapters I'm curios about:
- Chapter 1. Introduction to general HTTP
- Chapter 5. How web content and server are built in real world
- Appendices.

- Add the project to github - DONE

What put method does ?
1. Check if request file already exists
|-> If yes, then replace it with request file
--> If not, then add it.
-- DONE --
2. Send response with 201 (created) status and url, addressing a place were file was created.
